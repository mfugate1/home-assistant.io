The SleepIQ integration lets you view sensor data from [SleepIQ by SleepNumber](https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleepiq-sleep-tracker). In particular, it lets you see the occupancy and current SleepNumber (ie current firmness) of each side of a SleepNumber bed.

You will need an account on [SleepIQ](https://sleepiq.sleepnumber.com/) to use this integration.

## Configuration

1. In the **Configuration** > **Devices & Services** menu, click **+** and then select "ecobee" from the pop-up menu.
2. In the pop-up box, enter your username and password for your SleepIQ account. Optionally, choose a custom scan interval (the default is to check for updates every 60 seconds).
3. Click **Submit**. If the account information is valid, a configuration entry will be created and your SleepNumber sensors will be available in Home Assistant.

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer to set up the integration in `configuration.yaml`, add your username and password as follows:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sleepiq:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  scan_interval: 60
```
